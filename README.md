# Airbnb-Listings-Analysis
Airbnb encourages users to share their experiences about their stay in these accommodations - that may include about the host, food, culture, behavior, nature etc. The objective of the project is to analyze Airbnb data to identify key factors which may help other travelers before making their final choice.
